## 1. Peripherals and his types 
**Definition:** Peripherals are devices that connecto to a computer to expand its functions. Here are some principal characteristics:

**Types** 

Portability: Some peripherals, like keyboards, mouses, hard external disks, are lightery easy to transport.

Conectividad: They connect to the computer through USB ports, Bluetooth, Wi-fi or especific cables (HDMI, VHGA, etc.).

Functionality: Each peripheral had a especifical function: keyboard to writing, mouse to move the cursor, printer to print, etc.

Compability: They must be compatible with the OP of the computer for working right.

Power: Some periherals works with batteries, while others are powered through the computer or they have their own source of energy.

Design: Peripherals can be ergonomic or compact, according to the use and comfort of the user.

**Examples**

Printers.

Keyboards.

Mouses.

Network devices.

Monitors.


## 2. Printer
**Definition:** Device used to print on paper images, text, graphics, etc…

**Types**

- Dot Matrix Printers 
These printers are known for their speed and efficiency in printing documents, brochures, and other digital files. They use an impact mechanism to print by striking a ribbon against paper with pins. Dot matrix printecs are typically Classified by the number of pins they use: 1, 9, 18, or 27 pins.

- 3D Printers 
  3D printers are among the most innovative and modern types. They can print complex designs and objects, making them highly versatile. The main types of 3D printers include: 
  - Stereolithography (SLA): Uses liquid resin hardened by ultraviolet (U) light to create 3D objects. 
  - Selective Laser Sintering (SLS): Utilizes pondered materials like ceramics and nylon, which are fused using a laser. 
  - Inkiet: Simple design, similar to traditional inkjet printers, using photopolymers. 
  - Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM): The most common and affordable 3D printing method, which melts material to build objects layer by layer. 

- Impact Printers 
  These printers use an impact mechanism to transfer ink onto paper, often using pins, hammers, or other mechanisms. Types of impact printers include: 
  - Margarita Fixation Printers: Uses a flower-like mechanism where the ink is applied, and hammers strike to print text. 
  -  Sphere Fixation Printers: Uses a rotating sphere to position letters before an impact mechanism fixes the ink. 
  -  Line Fixation Printers: An advanced impact printer with a rotating drum that prints entire lines of text with each strike. 

- Laser Printers 
  Laser printers offer high-quality, fast printing, reducing costs compared to older technologies. They are categorized into: 
  - Monochrone Laser Printers: Use black toner to prânt text or images. 
  - Color Laser Printers: Use separate toner cartridges for each color (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) to print in full color. 

- Plotter Printers 
 Plotters are high-tech printers primarily used in engineering for printing vector graphics. Types of plotters include: 
  - Pen Plotters: Use pens or pencils of various sizes to print deavings, ideal for plans, vectors, and ECGs. 
  - Ink or Laser Plotters: Similar to other laser printers but designed for large-scale protects with large paper dimensions. 
  - Cutting Plotters: Do not use ink but instead cut materials like fabric, vinyl, and posters. 

- Thermal Printers 
Thermal printers are used for printing on chemically treated paper or PVC materials, such as ID cards. These printers work by exposing the material to heat from a print head, which darkens the print area.

## 3. Keyboard
**Definition:** Device that works as an electric switch to give an information output to the pc.

**Types**

- Types of Keyboards by Connection: 
  - Wired Keyboards: These typically connect via USB ports for desktop computes (PS/2 and serial ports are outdated). Laptops have internal connections based on the keyboard type used. 
  - Wireless Keyboards: These come in two main models: 
    - Bluetooth: Most commonly used today with efficient connectivity. 
    - Radio Erequency (RF): Less common now compared to a decade ago. 
  
- Types of Keyboards by Mechanism or Function: 
  - Membrane Keyboards: Comon in most computers, they are silent, shallow, and easy to clean. When keys are pressed, two sheets connect, completing a circuit to detect the key pressed. 
  - Mechanical Keyboards: Use mechanical switches and are noisier and more expensive than membrane keyboacds. They were common in older computers and are still popular in the gaming community due to their tactile feedback. 
  - Touch Keyboards: Fully digital and used in devices like smartphones and tablets, where the screen detects the touch of fingers. 
  
- Types of Keyboards by Design and Use: 
  - Standard Keyboard: A simple keyboard, usually with 102-105 keys, found in offices and schools.
  - Ergonomic Keyboard: Designed to sepacate hands for a sore natural typing position, often with wrist supports for long usage periods. 
  - Multimedia Keyboard: Includes extra buttons for controlling multimedia functions like volume and track changes, often integrated into F1-F12 keys. 
  - Flexible Keyboard: Made from rubber, this keyboard can be folded or rolled up, making it portable and silent but saccificing key precision and ergonomics. 
  - Braille Keyboard: Designed for visually impaired users, these keyboards feature braille for reading.  
  - Gaming Keyboard: Tallored for gamers, featuring extra keys, customizable functions, backlighting, and often mechanical switches for better performance.
